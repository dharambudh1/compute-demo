# Compute Demo

It is a sample project that uses the compute function in Flutter.

## What is the `compute` function?
The `compute` function is a built-in function in the Flutter framework. It allows developers to execute computationally intensive operations in a separate `isolate`. An `isolate` is a lightweight thread of execution that runs in parallel with the `main UI thread` of your Flutter app. Using an `isolate` - you can perform expensive computations without blocking the `main UI thread` and causing your app to become unresponsive. 

Here's a demo of fetching data from large JSON in two different ways.
- Load Without `compute`
- Load Using `compute`
